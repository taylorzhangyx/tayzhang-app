# PRD — Personal Website MVP v0.1 (Next.js)

## 1) Objective

Build a minimal personal website that makes it easy for peers/builders (primary) and recruiters/hiring managers (secondary) to:

1. discover your technical writing quickly

2. follow you via LinkedIn/GitHub links

3. understand who you are + what you’re focused on now

## 2) Scope

### In scope (MVP)

* Pages:

  * `/` Home

  * `/writing` Writing index

  * `/writing/[slug]` Post page

  * `/about` About + embedded “Now”

* Feature:

  * **Search** on `/writing` (title/tags/description only)

* “Follow” mechanism:

  * Prominent **LinkedIn + GitHub links** (header + footer + post pages)

### Out of scope (explicit)

* Newsletter, analytics/event tracking

* Accessibility requirements beyond “don’t break obvious things”

* Post body search

* Comments, accounts/auth, projects page, lab/apps, CMS UI, multi-language

* Draft/unpublished content handling

## 3) Success criteria (definition of done)

* A visitor can:

  * click into writing within 1–2 interactions from Home

  * search posts by keyword on `/writing`

  * reach your LinkedIn/GitHub from any page within 1 click

* Content:

  * at least N posts render correctly (N provided by you; default test with 10+)

* Sharing:

  * post pages have correct title + description metadata (basic OG is optional but recommended)

## 4) Global UX requirements

### Navigation

* Header nav: **Home / Writing / About**

* Header “Follow” area: icons/links to **GitHub + LinkedIn**

* Footer repeats GitHub + LinkedIn links

### Consistency

* Consistent layout shell across pages (header/footer)

* Consistent post template

## 5) Page requirements

### 5.1 `/` Home

**Primary job:** communicate what you do and route visitors to Writing and Follow links fast.

**Must-have**

* Hero section:

  * One-line positioning statement (provided by you)

  * 2 proof bullets (provided by you)

* CTA: “Read writing” → `/writing`

* Featured writing: 3–5 curated posts (manual list)

* Follow links visible (GitHub + LinkedIn)

**Acceptance criteria**

* Above the fold includes: positioning + “Read writing” CTA + follow links.

### 5.2 `/writing` Writing index

**Primary job:** browse and search posts.

**Must-have**

* “Start here” section: 3–5 curated posts (manual list)

* Search input at top

* Post list showing for each post:

  * title

  * date

  * description (1-line excerpt)

  * tags

* Tag filter (single-select is sufficient)

**Search behavior (MVP)**

* Searches across: `title`, `tags`, `description`

* Case-insensitive

* Partial matching (e.g., “agent” matches “agents”)

* Multi-keyword search (space-separated terms narrow results)

**Empty states**

* No query: show Start here + latest posts

* No results: show “No matches” + show Start here posts

**Acceptance criteria**

* Searching a keyword updates results without full page reload.

* Tag filter works and is predictable (tag narrows the list; search further narrows within tag).

### 5.3 `/writing/[slug]` Post page

**Primary job:** read comfortably; discover next post; follow you.

**Must-have**

* Post header:

  * title

  * date

  * tags

  * reading time (computed; if you want to skip, mark as optional—but it’s cheap and useful)

* Related posts:

  * show 3 posts based on shared tags (fallback to recent posts if insufficient)

* Follow links visible (GitHub + LinkedIn) in header/footer (and optionally a small inline “Follow” block at end)

**TOC**

* Optional. Only add if it’s already easy; otherwise out of scope.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Every post page shows tags + related posts + follow links.

### 5.4 `/about` About + Now

**Primary job:** establish credibility and current focus.

**Must-have**

* About section (short narrative, 4–8 sentences)

* Now section:

  * “Updated: YYYY-MM-DD”

  * 3 blocks max:

    * Building

    * Learning

* Follow links (GitHub + LinkedIn)

**Acceptance criteria**

* “Now” section is clearly dated and easy to scan.

## 6) Content model (Markdown frontmatter)

### Required fields

* `title` (string)

* `date` (ISO string or parseable date)

* `tags` (string array)

* `description` (string)

* `slug` (string) **or** derive from filename (pick one approach and enforce consistently)

### Notes

* All posts are published; **no&#x20;**`draft`**&#x20;field** and no draft logic.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Build fails clearly (or logs clearly) if a post is missing required fields.

## 7) SEO (minimal)

* Per-page title + meta description

* Post pages use `description` for meta description

(Anything beyond that is optional; do not block MVP.)

## 8) Risks

* **Risk:** search quality is weak without body indexing **Mitigation:** keep descriptions meaningful; curate “Start here”.

* **Risk:** homepage copy is vague **Mitigation:** keep positioning + proof bullets extremely concrete.
